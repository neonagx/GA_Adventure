#Project 1: GA Adventure

##About GA Adventure

GA Adventure is an interactive story game where the Adventurer is a no body who is trying to earn title "First Three Weeks Master" by defeating three stages.  Each stage has a monster that asks either 10 HTML, CSS or Javascript questions.  Getting 5 or more questions after 10 questions allows the Adventurer to move to next stage.  Less than that, Adventurer is devoured and defeated, which leads to Game Over.  Passing all three stages makes you become the "First Three Weeks Master" and adventure continues on...or so you think.
